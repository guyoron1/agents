# after_each hook: capture PR state and diff created by the code agent.
#
# The code agent receives an issue fixture, but the post-script creates
# a PR on the ephemeral repo. This hook finds that PR and captures its
# state so judges can evaluate the implementation quality.
#
# Required env (forward-propagated from setup-fixture.sh):
#   EPHEMERAL_REPO  — org/name of the ephemeral repo
#   FIXTURE_NUMBER  — issue number
#
# Required env (set by harness):
#   CASE_WORKSPACE  — path to the case workspace
