# PR Risk Assessment Scoring Model

This skill defines the composite risk scoring model for pull requests.
It combines metadata signals (Tier 1), git history analysis (Tier 2),
and linked issue context (Tier 3) into a single 1-5 risk score with a
categorical level.

## Scoring Model

The composite risk score is a weighted average of three tiers:

- **Tier 1 (Metadata):** 50% — deterministic signals extracted by script
- **Tier 2 (Git History):** 30% — churn analysis, author diversity, fix/revert patterns
- **Tier 3 (Linked Issue):** 20% — issue scope, labels, acceptance criteria

**Weight redistribution:** When a tier is unavailable, redistribute
its weight proportionally to the remaining tiers:

| Available tiers | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| All three | 50% | 30% | 20% |
| Tier 1 + Tier 2 (no issue) | 62% | 38% | — |
| Tier 1 + Tier 3 (shallow repo) | 71% | — | 29% |
| Tier 2 + Tier 3 (API failure) | — | 60% | 40% |
| Tier 1 only | 100% | — | — |
| Tier 2 only | — | 100% | — |
| Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 absent | Use Tier 1 = 3 (unknown baseline) | — | — |

Each tier produces a sub-score on a 1-5 scale. The composite score is
the weighted sum, rounded to the nearest integer.

**Score-to-level mapping:**
- **1 = low** — routine change, minimal risk
- **2 = moderate** — standard review adequate
- **3 = elevated** — requires careful review
- **4 = high** — requires expert review
- **5 = critical** — requires multi-reviewer consensus

## Tier 1: Metadata Signals

The `risk-tier1.sh` script outputs these KEY=VALUE signals and emits
the Tier 1 composite as `TIER1_SCORE`. The table below documents the
rubric the script applies (a 1-5 sub-score per dimension, averaged over
8 dimensions, not 10 — see the "Change size" composite below); use it
directly only when `TIER1_SCORE` is `UNKNOWN`. Otherwise take
`TIER1_SCORE` as given and do not re-derive it — re-deriving these
deterministic signals in the LLM is what made the same PR flip between
1 and 2 across re-reviews.

| Signal | Meaning | Scoring Guidance (1-5) |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| **Change size** (composite) | Combines `FILES_CHANGED`, `LINES_CHANGED`, and `BLAST_RADIUS` into a single dimension. Score each individually per the rows below, then take the **max** as one sub-score. This prevents raw diff size from dominating qualitative signals. | max(FILES score, LINES score, BLAST score) |
| ↳ `FILES_CHANGED` | Number of files modified | 1-3 files = 1, 4-10 = 2, 11-25 = 3, 26-50 = 4, >50 = 5 |
| ↳ `LINES_CHANGED` | Total lines added + deleted | <100 = 1, 100-299 = 2, 300-799 = 3, 800-1999 = 4, ≥2000 = 5 |
| ↳ `BLAST_RADIUS` | Size classification (derived from FILES_CHANGED × LINES_CHANGED) | small = 1, medium = 3, large = 5 |
| `PROTECTED_PATH_COUNT` | Count of protected path changes | 0 = 1, 1 = 3, ≥2 = 5 |
| `SECURITY_SENSITIVE_COUNT` | Count of security-sensitive path changes | 0 = 1, 1 = 3, 2-3 = 4, ≥4 = 5 |
| `CI_WORKFLOW_CHANGED` | Boolean: CI/workflow files changed | false = 1, true = 4 |
| `DEPENDENCY_FILES_CHANGED` | List of dependency files (comma-separated) or "none" | none = 1, 1 file = 3, ≥2 files = 5 |
| `TEST_FILE_RATIO` | Ratio of test files to total files (0.00-1.00). For docs/config-only PRs (no source files), treat 0.00 as neutral (score 1, not 5) | ≥0.50 = 1, 0.30-0.49 = 2, 0.10-0.29 = 3, 0.01-0.09 = 4, 0.00 = 5 |
| `AUTHOR_IS_BOT` | Boolean: authored by bot account | true = 1, false = 2 |
| `AUTHOR_IS_FIRST_TIME` | Boolean: first-time contributor | false = 1, true = 4 |

**Handling UNKNOWN values:** If a signal is `UNKNOWN`, skip it when
computing the Tier 1 average (do not count it as 0 or any default).
Only average the successfully computed sub-scores. For the Change size
composite, if all three component signals are UNKNOWN, skip the entire
composite dimension.

**`TIER1_SCORE` and `RISK_FLOOR`:** the script's last two lines are the
Tier 1 composite computed from this table and the floor — `2` when any
security-sensitive path is touched, else `1`. Use both as given; the
script computes them so the score is the same on every run
(re-deriving deterministic signals in the LLM is what made the same PR
flip between 1 and 2 across re-reviews).

**Tier 1 degenerate case:** If all dimensions are UNKNOWN (e.g., the
initial API call failed), treat Tier 1 as unavailable and redistribute
per the weight table above.

## Tier 2: Git History Signals

For each file in the PR's changed file list, run git log commands to
evaluate churn, author diversity, and fix/revert patterns. Aggregate
the file-level results into dimension scores.

| Dimension | Command | Scoring Guidance (1-5) |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| **Churn hotspot** | `git log --since="30 days ago" --oneline -- <file>` | Count commits in last 30 days per file. Average across files. <2 = 1, 2-5 = 2, 6-10 = 3, 11-20 = 4, >20 = 5 |
| **Multi-author contention** | `git log --since="90 days ago" --format="%ae" -- <file> \| sort -u \| wc -l` | Average distinct authors per file. 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3-4 = 3, 5-7 = 4, >7 = 5 |
| **Recent regression history** | `git log --since="90 days ago" --oneline --grep="fix\|revert" --regexp-ignore-case -- <file>` | Count fix/revert commits per file. Average across files. 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 2-3 = 3, 4-6 = 4, >6 = 5 |
| **Code age/stability** | `git log -1 --format="%ci" -- <file>` | Days since last commit. Average across files. <7d = 1, 7-30d = 2, 31-90d = 3, 91-180d = 4, >180d = 5 |
| **Change coupling** | `git log --since="90 days ago" --format="%H" -- <file> \| xargs -I{} git show --name-only --format="" {} \| sort \| uniq -c \| sort -rn` | For each changed file, identify other files frequently modified together. Count files with coupling ≥3 co-commits missing from PR. Average across files. 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 2-3 = 3, 4-6 = 4, >6 = 5 |
| **Revert frequency** | `git log --all --oneline --grep="revert.*<file>" --regexp-ignore-case` | Count reverts on touched files (search commit messages for "revert" + file path). Average across files. 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 2-3 = 3, 4-6 = 4, >6 = 5 |
| **Commit message sentiment** | `git log --since="90 days ago" --oneline -- <file> \| grep -iE "workaround\|hack\|temporary\|todo\|fixme"` | Count commits with workaround/hack/temporary sentiment per file. Average across files. 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 2-3 = 3, 4-6 = 4, >6 = 5 |

**Procedure:** For each dimension, compute the per-file value, then
average across all changed files. Round the average to the nearest
integer for the dimension sub-score. Then average the seven dimension
sub-scores for the Tier 2 composite.

**Shallow repository detection:** Before running git log commands, check
`git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository`. If the repo is shallow, Tier 2
signals are unreliable — treat the entire tier as unavailable and
redistribute per the weight table above. The pre-review script deepens the clone when
`REVIEW_GIT_FETCH_DEPTH=0` is set, but the sub-agent must handle the
case where deepening failed or was not configured.

**Per-file cap:** For PRs with more than 20 changed files, sample the
top 20 files by lines changed instead of analyzing all files. This
prevents unbounded command fan-out.

**Error handling:** If a file does not exist in git history (e.g., newly
added), skip it for Tier 2 analysis. If all files are new, Tier 2 = 2
(moderate baseline).

## Tier 3: Linked Issue Signals

If the PR description or metadata links to an issue, evaluate these
dimensions. If no issue is linked, Tier 3 does not contribute (weight
redistributed to Tiers 1 and 2).

| Dimension | Evaluation Criteria | Scoring Guidance (1-5) |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Complexity vs scope mismatch** | Compare issue description scope to PR file/line count | Scope matches size = 1, slightly larger = 2, moderate mismatch = 3, significant mismatch = 4, PR much larger than issue scope = 5 |
| **Issue label context** | Check for risk-relevant labels (e.g., `breaking-change`, `security`, `needs-discussion`) | No risk labels = 1, 1 advisory label = 2, 1 warning label = 3, 2+ warning labels or 1 critical label = 5 |
| **Acceptance criteria coverage** | Does the PR address all acceptance criteria in the issue? | All criteria met = 1, most met = 2, some met = 3, few met = 4, none met or no criteria = 5 |
| **Discussion history** | Count of unresolved threads in the linked issue | 0 = 1, 1-2 = 2, 3-5 = 3, 6-10 = 4, >10 = 5 |
| **Issue age and staleness** | Time since issue opened vs last activity. Compute: days_open = (now - created_at), days_stale = (now - last_activity). | Recent active (open <7d, stale <2d) = 1, moderate (open 7-30d, stale 2-7d) = 2, aging (open 31-90d, stale 8-30d) = 3, old (open 91-180d, stale 31-90d) = 4, stale (open >180d or stale >90d) = 5 |
| **Rollback safety** | Check the PR diff for feature flags, env-var gates, or config toggles that allow the change to be disabled without a code change. Environment variables that guard new behavior (e.g., `FEATURE_X_ENABLED`) count as feature flags — check the diff and any referenced config files for these. Also consider whether the change is additive-only (new files/endpoints) vs modifying existing behavior. | Feature flag, default disabled (opt-in) = 1, feature flag, default enabled (opt-out) = 2, additive-only change, no flag but easily revertible = 3, modifies existing behavior, no flag = 4, irreversible change (schema migration, data format, breaking API) = 5 |

**Procedure:** Evaluate each dimension, assign a 1-5 sub-score, then
average for the Tier 3 composite.

**Graceful degradation:** If issue context is unavailable or partial,
score only the available dimensions and average them. If no dimensions
can be scored, omit Tier 3 entirely and redistribute per the weight
table above.

## Anchoring Examples

Use these examples to calibrate scoring across tiers.

| Scenario | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Composite | Level |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Typo fix in README, 1 file, 2 lines, no issue | 1.1 | 1.0 | N/A | **1** (0.62×1.1 + 0.38×1.0 = 1.06 → 1) | low |
| Add logging to existing function, 3 files, 80 lines, issue with clear scope | 1.3 | 2.0 | 1.5 | **2** (0.50×1.3 + 0.30×2.0 + 0.20×1.5 = 1.55 → 2) | moderate |
| Refactor auth module, 12 files, 450 lines, high churn, issue scope matches | 2.6 | 3.8 | 2.0 | **3** (0.50×2.6 + 0.30×3.8 + 0.20×2.0 = 2.84 → 3) | elevated |
| Dependency upgrade + protected path edits, 8 files, 300 lines, breaking-change label | 2.9 | 3.0 | 4.0 | **3** (0.50×2.9 + 0.30×3.0 + 0.20×4.0 = 3.15 → 3) | elevated |
| Security fix in crypto module, 2 files, 60 lines, protected paths, urgent issue with unresolved threads | 2.6 | 4.5 | 4.5 | **4** (0.50×2.6 + 0.30×4.5 + 0.20×4.5 = 3.55 → 4) | high |
| Large feature with CI + dependency changes, 40 files, 2000+ lines, first-time contributor, no issue | 4.0 | 3.5 | N/A | **4** (0.62×4.0 + 0.38×3.5 = 3.81 → 4) | high |
| New feature behind opt-out flag, 15 files, 600 lines, issue scope matches, flag in env var | 2.4 | 2.5 | 1.8 | **2** (0.50×2.4 + 0.30×2.5 + 0.20×1.8 = 2.31 → 2) | moderate |

## Output Format

The sub-agent must return a JSON object with this schema:

```json
{
  "score": 3,
  "level": "elevated",
  "tier1_score": 2.62,
  "risk_floor": 1,
  "tier1_signals": [
    {"dimension": "FILES_CHANGED", "value": "12"},
    {"dimension": "LINES_CHANGED", "value": "450"},
    {"dimension": "BLAST_RADIUS", "value": "medium"}
  ],
  "tier2_signals": [
    {"dimension": "recent_commit_frequency_30d", "value": "8.5"},
    {"dimension": "distinct_authors_90d", "value": "3.2"}
  ],
  "tier3_signals": [
    {"dimension": "issue_scope_vs_pr_size", "value": "2"},
    {"dimension": "issue_labels", "value": "1"}
  ],
  "rationale": "Moderate file count and churn, auth module with high recent activity, issue scope aligns with PR size."
}
```

**Required fields:**
- `score` (integer 1-5)
- `level` (string: "low", "moderate", "elevated", "high", "critical")
- `rationale` (string: one-sentence summary of why this score was assigned)
- `tier1_score` (number) and `risk_floor` (integer 1-5) — copied from the
  script's `TIER1_SCORE` / `RISK_FLOOR` lines; omit only when the script
  returned `UNKNOWN`

**Optional fields:**
- `tier1_signals` (array of {dimension, value} objects)
- `tier2_signals` (array of {dimension, value} objects)
- `tier3_signals` (array of {dimension, value} objects)
- `degraded` (string) — set only by the orchestrator's fallback
  (`"tier1-only"`) when this sub-agent was unavailable

The signal arrays enable graceful degradation: if a tier cannot be
fully evaluated, return partial signals or omit the array entirely.

**Output constraint:** Return raw JSON only — do not wrap in markdown
code fences (`` ```json ... ``` ``). The orchestrator parses the
response directly.

## Procedure

1. **Run Tier 1 script:**
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/skills/pr-risk-assessment/scripts/risk-tier1.sh"
   ```
   Capture KEY=VALUE output. Parse each line and store signals.

2. **Take the Tier 1 composite from the script:**
   `TIER1_SCORE` is the Tier 1 composite. Do not re-derive it. Only if
   it is `UNKNOWN`: assign a 1-5 sub-score per signal from the Tier 1
   table and average the valid ones (skip `UNKNOWN` values).

3. **Evaluate Tier 2 dimensions:**
   For each file in the PR's changed file list, run the git log
   commands from the Tier 2 table. Aggregate per-file results into
   dimension averages. Compute the average of the seven dimension
   sub-scores. This is the Tier 2 composite score.

4. **Evaluate Tier 3 dimensions (if issue linked):**
   If the PR links to an issue, evaluate each Tier 3 dimension per the
   criteria table. Compute the average of all valid sub-scores. This is
   the Tier 3 composite score. If no issue is linked, skip this step.

5. **Compute weighted composite:**
   - If Tier 3 is available: `score = 0.50×Tier1 + 0.30×Tier2 + 0.20×Tier3`
   - If Tier 3 is unavailable: `score = 0.62×Tier1 + 0.38×Tier2`
   Round to the nearest integer (1-5), then apply the floor:
   `score = max(score, RISK_FLOOR)`. A security-sensitive path never
   scores low, whatever the history and issue tiers say.

6. **Map score to level:**
   - 1 → "low"
   - 2 → "moderate"
   - 3 → "elevated"
   - 4 → "high"
   - 5 → "critical"

7. **Write rationale:**
   One sentence summarizing the key factors (file count, churn, labels,
   protected paths, rollback safety, etc.) that drove the score.

8. **Verify score-rationale coherence:**
   Re-read the rationale and cross-check it against the score using the
   anchoring examples table above. Specifically:
   - Identify the risk characteristics described in the rationale
     (e.g., "docs-only," "no protected paths," "bot author").
   - Map those characteristics to expected sub-scores per the Tier 1/2/3
     scoring guidance tables.
   - If the rationale describes characteristics that the scoring
     guidance maps to a different score than the one assigned, either
     adjust the score to match what the signals actually produce, or
     revise the rationale to explain the specific signal that elevates
     or lowers the score beyond what the described characteristics
     alone would suggest.
   - Example violation: rationale says "Documentation-only PR by a bot
     with no protected paths, no security-sensitive files, no dependency
     changes" but score is 2. The Tier 1 scoring guidance maps all
     those characteristics to sub-scores of 1, producing a composite
     near 1. The score must be 1, or the rationale must cite a
     specific Tier 2/3 signal (e.g., "high churn in the last 30 days")
     that justifies the elevation.

9. **Return JSON:**
   Construct the JSON object per the schema above. Return it as raw
   JSON (no markdown fences).
