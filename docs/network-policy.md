# Custom network policy

Agents run inside an OpenShell sandbox that restricts outbound network
access. If a package install or build step fails because the sandbox
blocks a host your project needs, create a custom policy that adds the
missing endpoints.

## How the sandbox policy works

The policy controls two things:

- **Endpoints** -- which hosts and ports a process can connect to.
- **Binaries** -- which executables are allowed to use each endpoint.

A request is allowed only when both the destination host and the calling
binary match an entry in the policy. Even if a host is in the allowlist,
only the listed binaries can reach it. `curl` is excluded from GitHub-forge profiles to prevent raw HTTP
access with injected credentials. The GitLab and Jira forge profiles
allow `curl` because their API access requires it (the `gh` CLI is not
available for GitLab or Jira).

All agents share the base policy
[`policies/base.yaml`](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/agents/blob/main/policies/base.yaml). Forge-specific network
access (GitHub, GitLab, Jira endpoints) is provided by profiles under
[`profiles/`](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/agents/tree/main/profiles) and wired in via forge-level or overlay
sections in each harness file. See the individual profile files for the
full list of allowed hosts and binaries.

## Before you start

- You have a custom harness (`.fullsend/<agent>.yaml`) in your
  repository for the agent you want to configure. If you do not have
  one yet, see [Customizing agents](https://fullsend.sh/docs/guides/user/customizing-agents.html)
  for how to create one.
- You know which host is being blocked. Check the agent logs for
  `ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `npm ERR! network`, or similar
  connection errors that name the blocked hostname.

## Add custom endpoints to the policy

### 1. Create a policy file

Copy the default policy for the agent you are configuring (for example,
[`policies/base.yaml`](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/agents/blob/main/policies/base.yaml) for the code agent) to
`.fullsend/policies/<agent>.yaml` in your repository and append a
block for the host you need:

```yaml
network_policies:
  # ... existing policies from the base file ...
  your_policy:
    name: custom-hosts
    endpoints:
      - host: "example.com"
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        enforcement: enforce
        access: read-only
    binaries:
      - path: "**/node"
      - path: "**/npm"
```

Use `access: read-only` unless the endpoint requires write access.

Some URLs contain encoded slashes (`%2F`). If the endpoint you are
adding uses them (common with Go module proxies and some GitHub
download paths), add `allow_encoded_slash: true` to the endpoint
entry. See the
[OpenShell policy schema reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/reference/policy-schema)
for the full list of available fields.

### 2. Reference the policy in your harness

Add the `policy:` field to `.fullsend/<agent>.yaml`:

```yaml
# .fullsend/<agent>.yaml
base: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fullsend-ai/agents/<SHA>/harness/<agent>.yaml#sha256=<sha256sum>
policy: policies/<agent>.yaml
```

If you already have a custom harness (for example, with a
[custom sandbox image](code.md#custom-sandbox-image)), add the
`policy:` field alongside the existing fields.

### 3. Test the policy

Trigger the agent again and check the logs for new connection errors.
Policy changes often need a few rounds of iteration -- the first blocked
host you fix may reveal a second one behind it (for example, a registry
that redirects to a CDN). Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the agent run
succeeds.

### 4. Repeat for other agents

All agents share `policies/base.yaml` with forge-specific network
access provided by profiles. If multiple agents need the same custom
hosts, create a separate override for each one. For example, the
[code](code.md) and [fix](fix.md) agents both use
[`policies/base.yaml`](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/agents/blob/main/policies/base.yaml)
(GitLab network access is provided by forge-level profiles such as
`fullsend-gitlab-code` and `fullsend-gitlab-ro`).

## Troubleshooting

When a package install fails due to a blocked host, look for connection
errors in the agent logs:

| Symptom | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| `ECONNREFUSED` or `ETIMEDOUT` on a hostname | Host is not in the policy |
| `npm ERR! network` followed by a hostname | npm cannot reach the registry or download URL |
| `pip` or `go get` failure referencing an external URL | Download host is not in the policy |

To identify which host to add:

1. Find the failing command in the agent log output.
2. Look for the hostname in the error message (for example,
   `codeload.github.com`).
3. Add the host to your custom policy under an appropriate
   `network_policies` entry with the binaries that need access.
